# Pytorch3d playground

Learning [PyTorch3D](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d) in order to work on a university project for mesh transformation.

The first tutorial I made is based on the ["deform a source mesh to form a target mesh"](https://pytorch3d.org/tutorials/deform_source_mesh_to_target_mesh) tutorial.

From this, I learned how to load objects and meshes and how to modify them.

The next thing I read about is [rendering texture](https://pytorch3d.org/tutorials/render_textured_meshes)

For mesh texturing there is several options : vertex textures, UV textures and face textures
